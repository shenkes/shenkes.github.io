                            I was fortunate enough to be the Vice President of the Game Development Club at Iowa State University as a senior. As Vice President,
                            I helped lead weekly meetings, held educational workshops for members of the club, planned events such as Game Jams
                            and social nights, and fostered a welcoming and engaging community on campus. Holding this position helped make me
                            a more effective and cognizant leader. Being responsible for one of the most active clubs on campus also
                            helped me develop managerial, cooperative, and social skills.

                            I shifted my focus away from complex mechanics and towards a polished, well designed experience.
                            I believe I achieved that goal, and to me this is one of my proudest achievements because
                            people can pick up a controller and instantly start having fun. I think this speaks to the simplicity
                            and completeness of the project.

                            animations with models. The goal is to avoid the 'CyBots', collect the two power-ups, and get
                            to the campanile. The game also has procedurally generated maps using cellular automata. This
                            project helped me understand the design process of making a properly animated and modeled game,
                            and the difficulties of bringing it all together with AI. I'm very happy with how expressive the CyBots are and
                            the atmosphere created with the game. The models were provided by iowa State University, and the enemies are our
                            school's mascot. Mixamo was used for animations.

                        <p class="card-text">This was a project completed for class where we were tasked with implementing the Minimax algorithm to create an AI player than could
                            beat us. Unfortunately, I was unable to find the optimal evaluation function to result in a consistently winning AI, but
                            it was still a great way to learn the algorithm. Aside from the algorithm, I'm proud of the look and feel of the game. I
                            think the UIis straighforward and effective, and the grass in the background give the game a great relaxing feeling.
                            3D models and animations were provided to us by Iowa State University. The grass effect comes from Stylized Forest Lite on
                            the Unity Asset Store.

                            gaining more abilities to assist it in exploring the world of the game.
                            Inspiration comes from Metroidvanias and classic platformers such as Mega Man and Super Mario.
                            My role in this project was gameplay programmer, level designer and 2D asset creator (the header of this page is actually used as a background in the game).
                            The game was made in Unity. Creating this game gave me insight into how to create something that can be played from start to finish, how to design interesting challenges,
                            how to integrate assets into the game and more. My teammate and I were fortunate enough to get an honorable mention for the art-style and unique combination of mechanics.
