## About [Particle System](https://github.com/shenkes/particle_system)

**Project description:** (Finished) <br>
As a final project for Computer Graphics (COMS 336) I collaborated with [Ben Kramer](https://github.com/bckramer) to make a customizable particle system using JavaScript, HTML, and WebGL. We completed the Particle System over the course of about 2 weeks and demonstrated our project in front of the class. This was one of my favorite projects to work on because of how modular it was to work on and how impactful optimizations of the Particle System were. In development, we discovered a few different uses for our newly created Particle System by adjusting different values as shown below.

### Next Steps
We achieved our original goals in making the Particle System, but if we come back to it we have a few things we would like to do.
* Embed the Particle System in this page (or at least a link to it)
* Make the option to change the number of particles accessable from the browser (currently hardcoded)
* Make the user interface more user friendly - set limits on numbers or perhaps add sliders
* Add more user options - shapes, rotation with variance, etc.
