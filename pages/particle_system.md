## About Particle System

**Project description:** (Finished with potential to return to) <br>
As a final project for Computer Graphics (COMS 336) I collaborated with [Ben Kramer](https://github.com/bckramer) to make a customizable particle system using JavaScript, HTML, and WebGL. We completed the Particle System over the course of about 2 weeks and demonstrated our project in front of the class. This was one of my favorite projects to work on because of how modular it was to work on and how impactful optimizations of the Particle System were. In development, we discovered a few different uses for our newly created Particle System by adjusting different values as shown below.
