## About Dual

**Project description:** (Finished - April 2018) <br>
One of the most enjoyable projects that I've worked on and the winner of the Iowa State University's Game Development Club Partner Jam, Dual was created in 48 hours from scratch by Connor Kocolowski and me. Dual is a fast paced competative puzzle solving game between 2 players using a single keyboard made in Unity using C#. The game is complete with a menu, tutorial, 4 puzzles, and a completion screen.

To create puzzles to be solved by others was a new experience to me, and I really enjoyed it. To see others pick up the instructions from the tutorial as well as concieve strategies to overcome the puzzles that I engineered on a whiteboard is invigorating to watch. It is fascinating to watch the gears turn inside of the heads of people from varying backgrounds as they race to finish before each other, much as how I puzzled together how to create those very challenges in a short timeframe.

I encourage you to download the game and find someone to play with.

### Next Steps
We created as much as we could hope for in the Partner Jam and were happy with where we ended. I will not be adding to this, but I did very much enjoy making it and there is room for improvement so here are some ideas I have for a second version of the game
* Embed the game in this page
* Make the menu accessable from any screen
* Update the graphics
* More puzzles!!! (and maybe split the puzzles into seperate races of varying difficulties)
* Add sound control and resolution options
* Make it harder for people to pass by the reset button in the tutorial without noticing
* Randomly generated puzzles
