                            <p class="card-text">Radminton was my senior design project I developed with a team of five other engineering students. Our mentor was a 
                                big badminton fan and wanted to be able to record footage of a game and get auto generated feedback using computer vision. This included not only 
                                a video processing application to mark the video, but also an easy to use front-end website.

                            <p class="card-text">
                                My main tasks included shuttlecock recognition, which required clever use of computer vision as well as more traditional 
                                algorithms to give the highest level of certainty to the location of the object. I also developed for the front-end website 
                                and added visual markers to demonstrate what the application was doing and thinking.

                            <p class="card-text">Pocket Aces was me and a friend's final project for a graduate course at ISU: HCI 575: Computational Perception. Pocket Aces utilized computer vision to analyze a computer poker program, identifying
                                cards, pot sizes, public cards and more. After it had analyzed the screen, it would make a decision after feeding the information into a neural network. The project was done
                                entirely in Python using OpenCV and TensorFlow.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                My main task was implementing the computer vision aspect of Pocket Aces, and I'm happy to report that Pocket Aces was highly accurate at identifying the desired information.
                                The approach was to use structuring elements to identify areas of interest on the screen, but this method was not always perfect. One of my proudest achievements
                                on the project, was developing my own algorithm that, given an image, will identify areas of interest on its own and then dissect the information in the image.
                                Below, you can find a link to the GitHub repository for Pocket Aces as well as the final report we wrote which includes results.

                            <p class="card-text">This was a final project for COM S 336: Introduction to Computer Graphics. As a team, another student and I created a simple particle system using
                            WebGL and Three.js. The version that you can try below uses 3000 particles that spread out over a period of time, despawn then spawn again. Using the various customizations,
                                many different effects and styles can be made.

                            <p>While challenging, this project was a ton of fun to make and taught me a lot about computer graphics. We began by naively spawning thousands of objects, only to
                            realize just how slow that would really be. Eventually, we learned how to maximize efficiency by using simple vertices and buffer attributes.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Myrtle is a project a team of two students and I did for the 2017 Fall Hackathon at Iowa State. We built a simple game, a genetic algorithm and a
                                neural network in Java in about thirty hours named Myrtl. The program would play the game, at first trying random actions, and then through genetic mutations and neural network modifications, learn how to play
                                the game. It was my first foray into the world of AI and one of the most challenging projects I've ever done. The team and I learned a ton about neural networks, machine learning and AI.

                            <p class="card-text">
                                I was in charge of the construction of the neural network, which was built from scratch in Java. No libraries were used, which meant I had to have a concrete grasp of the network
                                and what requirements it had to have if I was going to be successful. There were many times in which it was very difficult to conceptualize and visualize the network, but through perseverance I
                                came out successful. I also lent my hand in debugging and tweaking the genetic algorithm, which takes several network and selects the best traits to be passed onto a new generation.
